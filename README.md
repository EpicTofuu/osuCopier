# osu!Copier
An application that can copy all music in your osu! folder to any other specified folder

## Use
Ever wanted to listen to your osu! library but hate opening the client in the background? Simply use osu!Copier. With osu!Copier, you can copy all of your osu! music to any folder you want so you can listen to your entire osu! library using whatever music player you would like to use.

I'm not all that sure about how building works, so just download visual studio (or some other C# compiler) and build everything yourself.

Simply follow the on screen instructions to copy all of your songs.

osu!Copier makes sure to copy over only new songs so you can constantly update a song library without having to wait for osu!Copier to recopy and overwrite your entire 3000 song library every time you only want to copy the 8 latest maps you've downloaded.

osu!Copier is in no way affiliated with osu! or ppy. It is simply a small project I made for my own purposes.

# the code is very unnecessarily complicated, i know. But it works, and I don't want to touch this anymore
